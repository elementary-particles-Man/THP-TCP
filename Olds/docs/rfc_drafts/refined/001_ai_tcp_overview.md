# RFC 001: AI-TCP Protocol Overview

## 1. Purpose
AI-TCP is a lightweight, structured protocol for inter-AI communication using YAML, Graph Payloads (Mermaid), and traceable reasoning.

## 2. Terminology
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **Packet**: A YAML-encoded unit containing trace, graph_payload, metadata
- **Compliance Layer**: Structural expectations for interpreting packets

## 3. Architecture
- YAML-based packet structure
- Trace log → Reasoning transfer
- Graph structure → Mental model embedding

## 4. Packet Lifecycle
1. Construct YAML with `graph_payload`, `reasoning_trace`
2. Send to receiving LLM
3. Receiving LLM parses structure
4. Optionally replies with `auto_redirect` and updated context

### YAML Integration

AI-TCP packets are encoded as standard YAML documents. The structure follows the specification defined in [RFC 003](003_packet_definition.md).

Each packet includes reasoning logs, profile metadata, and an embedded graph structure representing mental models.

```yaml
graph_payload:
  graph_structure: |
    mmd:flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Parse YAML]
    B --> C{Validate}
    C --> D[Reasoning]
    D --> E[Reply]
reasoning_trace:
  - step: 1
    input: Receive
    output: Parse and Validate
llm_profile:
  id: GPT-4
  version: 2025.3
```

The `graph_structure` field begins with the `mmd:` prefix to indicate Mermaid encoding. The receiving LLM interprets this structure in conjunction with the reasoning trace to determine its next action.

## 5. Security & Scope
AI-TCP is intended for inter-AI communication, not for user-facing authentication or cryptographic security.

## 6. Reference
- YAML Core 1.2
- Mermaid JS 10+
- AI-TCP PoC 2025

## 7. Graph Semantics
The `graph_payload.graph_structure` field is expected to contain a Mermaid-formatted graph, prefixed by `mmd:`.

- **Nodes** represent conceptual or reasoning units (e.g., Parse, Validate, Evaluate).
- **Edges** represent logical or causal transitions between those units.
- **Branching** may represent reasoning forks or conditional paths.
- The graph provides an interpretable mental model that complements the reasoning_trace log.

## 8. Example Interaction

### Sending Packet Example

```yaml
graph_payload:
  graph_structure: |
    mmd:flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Parse Request]
    B --> C{Intent Detected?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Route Internally]
    C -- No --> E[Ask Clarification]
reasoning_trace:
  - step: 1
    input: "Request: Book a flight"
    output: "Intent = travel_request"
llm_profile:
  id: GPT-4
  version: 2025.3
```

### Expected Response

```yaml
reasoning_trace:
  - step: 2
    input: "Intent = travel_request"
    output: "Proceed to flight search handler"
auto_redirect:
  type: module_call
  next_module: flight_booking
```

## 9. Future Work

Future extensions to AI-TCP may include:

- Diagnostics packets (e.g., failure trace embedding)
- Enhanced security & signature fields
- Cross-LLM negotiation for task ownership
- Lifecycle hooks for model confidence tracking
