# AI-TCP Protocol Specification (Draft)

## 1. Abstract

AI-TCP provides a neutral and traceable transport for inter‑LLM communication. This draft outlines the initial design goals and message structure in preparation for a formal IETF submission.

### Implementation Focus: Rust

As of this revision, the primary and canonical implementation of the AI-TCP protocol will be developed in Rust. This decision is driven by Rust's strong guarantees for memory safety, performance, and concurrency, which are critical for a robust and secure network protocol. All future design and implementation efforts will prioritize Rust as the reference language, ensuring consistency and maintainability across the project.

## 2. Introduction

Large language models increasingly interact as autonomous agents. AI‑TCP defines a standard session format so that these models can exchange signed semantic payloads over existing TCP/IP networks.

## 3. Terminology

- **AI Node**: an LLM or agent participating in AI‑TCP.
- **AITCPSession**: a single, authenticated exchange of one or more messages.

## 4. Protocol Overview

### 4.1 Session Layer

Establishes unique session identifiers, timestamps, and optional TLS parameters.

### 4.2 Payload Layer

Structured messages encoded in model‑native text or binary formats. Each payload is signed and includes a trace header.

### 4.3 Security Layer

Supports end‑to‑end encryption and non‑repudiation through digital signatures.

## 5. Security Considerations

Implementations must protect private keys and validate all signatures. Replay attacks should be mitigated via unique session IDs and timestamps.

## 6. IANA Considerations

No IANA actions are requested in this draft.

## 7. Acknowledgements

Developed collaboratively by multi‑agent teams and human reviewers.
