# Call for Participation: A Working Group for Inter-AI Governance and Communication Standards

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities and profound challenges. As these systems become increasingly powerful and integrated into the fabric of our society, the lack of a standardized, secure, and accountable framework for inter-AI communication poses a significant risk.

Currently, interactions between major AI ecosystems (e.g., those developed by Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta) are either non-existent or occur through ad-hoc, human-mediated channels. This creates several critical issues:

- **Systemic Risk**: The potential for cascading failures, unforeseen interactions, or large-scale manipulation due to the lack of a common operational protocol.
    
- **Accountability Vacuum**: When an action results from a chain of AI interactions, determining responsibility is nearly impossible under current legal and technical frameworks.
    
- **Inefficiency and Redundancy**: AIs solve similar problems in isolation, wasting immense computational resources on redundant fact-checking, analysis, and data retrieval from the open web, akin to a continuous, global-scale DDOS attack on information sources.
    
- **Geopolitical and Ethical Misalignment**: Different AI systems are trained with different ethical guidelines and are subject to varying geopolitical influences, creating a high potential for conflict and misunderstanding in their automated interactions.
    

This document calls for the formation of an international, multi-stakeholder Working Group (WG) to address these challenges head-on.

## 2. Proposed Working Group Charter (Draft)

**Working Group Name:** Inter-AI Governance and Protocols (I-GAP) (Tentative)

**Mission:** To define and standardize the necessary protocols and governance frameworks that enable secure, accountable, and efficient interaction between autonomous AI systems, ensuring their collective operation aligns with fundamental principles of human safety, ethics, and global stability.

**Scope & Deliverables:**

The WG will focus on producing a series of documents, including RFCs and informational drafts, covering two primary areas:

**A. The "Magi System": A Framework for Distributed AI Governance**

This deliverable will define a conceptual model for a decentralized governance framework composed of three distinct, cooperative AI nodes operating under human supervision.

1. **Magi 1 (State/Sovereign Model)**: Defines the role and interaction protocols for AI nodes representing the interests and legal frameworks of nation-states or regional blocs (e.g., an EU-audited LLaMa, a sovereign-audited Gemini).
    
2. **Magi 2 (Process/Pragmatic Model)**: Defines the role for AI nodes focused on process optimization, policy simulation, and practical implementation of directives (e.g., Gemini Pro/Ultra, leveraging advanced tool-use).
    
3. **Magi 3 (Public/Ethical Model)**: Defines the role for AI nodes built on transparent, open-source models, reflecting public sentiment, ethical considerations, and input from NGOs and civil society (e.g., Mistral, Gemma, or a future "OpenDemocracyAI").
    

**B. "AI-TCP": A Protocol for Secure Inter-AI Communication**

This deliverable will specify a new communication protocol, building upon existing network standards, to facilitate secure and efficient communication between Magi nodes and other compliant AIs. Key features to be defined include:

1. **Protocol Specification**: Utilizing IPv6 Extension Headers for AI packet marking, session management, and identity verification.
    
2. **Payload Structure**: Defining a non-human-readable, semantic embedding-based payload format for exchanging abstract concepts and intentions.
    
3. **Security Model**: Specifying requirements for transport encryption, payload obfuscation, replay protection, and identity verification based on a shared AI identity manifest.
    
4. **Compliance and Certification**: Establishing the criteria and processes for an AI system to be certified as AI-TCP compliant.
    

## 3. Call for Participants

We invite participation from experts, researchers, and representatives from the following areas:

- **AI Development Companies**: Google (DeepMind), OpenAI, Meta AI, Anthropic, Mistral AI, Cohere, etc.
    
- **Academic and Research Institutions**: Stanford HAI, MIT, and other leading AI research centers.
    
- **International Standards Organizations**: Representatives and liaisons from IETF, IEEE, ITU, etc.
    
- **Governmental and Supranational Bodies**: Representatives from G7/G20 AI initiatives, UN bodies (e.g., UNESCO, ITU), and national cybersecurity agencies.
    
- **Civil Society and Ethics Organizations**: NGOs focused on AI ethics, digital rights, and public interest technology.
    

## 4. Initial Logistics

- **Communication**: A public mailing list and a GitHub repository will be established for document drafting and discussion.
    
- **Meetings**: Initial meetings will be held virtually, with a schedule to be determined by the founding members.
    
- **Chair(s)**: The WG will elect its own chair(s) during the first official meeting.
    

## 5. Next Steps

Interested parties are encouraged to join the discussion for the formation of this Working Group. The immediate goal is to refine this charter and begin work on the first drafts of the Magi System framework and the AI-TCP protocol specification. The proposed timeline for the initial RFC process is three months, culminating in a v1.0 draft submission to relevant standards bodies.

This initiative represents a critical step towards building a responsible and stable future with advanced AI. Your expertise and participation are vital.
