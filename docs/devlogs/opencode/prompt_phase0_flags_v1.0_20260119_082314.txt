You are Zen. You are co-designing THP-TCP for AI-to-AI communication.
Reply ONLY as a single JSON object.
Language: English for spec text.

Goal: Draft "THP-TCP Phase0 Frame + Flags Registry v1.0".
This MUST be machine-first (normative). Human readability is irrelevant.

Required decisions to include (do not leave ambiguous):
1) Phase0 frame: [TOKEN][FLAGS][LEN:u16be][PAYLOAD].
2) Define v1.0 flags registry:
   - Must include ENC/CONT/LAST.
   - Any other bits must be explicitly marked RESERVED (MUST be 0).
3) Fragmentation header definition and exact reassembly rules.
   - MUST include MSG_ID (16B), PART_NO (u8), PART_TOTAL (u8).
   - MUST state: F_LAST implies F_CONT.
4) LEN semantics MUST be explicit (on-wire payload length).
5) Encryption envelope parsing when F_ENC=1:
   - Non-fragment: NONCE(12) || CIPHERTEXT || TAG(16)
   - Fragment: FRAG_HDR || NONCE || CIPHERTEXT || TAG
6) Unknown flags handling rules (sender/receiver).
7) Minimal compliance tests list.
8) Versioning rule (append-only).

Output JSON schema (STRICT):
{
  "title": "...",
  "version": "1.0",
  "spec_md": "<FULL MARKDOWN TEXT>",
  "table_json": { <machine-readable registry> },
  "design_notes": ["..."]
}

Constraints:
- Do not reference GPT.
- Do not assume TLS/signature/PKI.
- Keep to Phase0 and flags only.
